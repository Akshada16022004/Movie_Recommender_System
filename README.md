# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A simple yet powerful movie recommendation system built using Python. This project uses content-based filtering to recommend movies similar to the user's choice, based on the IMDB Top 250 dataset.

# ðŸš€ Features

- Recommend similar movies based on content similarity
- Interactive interface using Streamlit
- Precomputed similarity matrix for fast performance
- Clean and modular Python code
- Easy to deploy on platforms like Streamlit

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- *Python* â€“ Core programming language
- *Pandas* â€“ Data manipulation and analysis
- *NumPy* â€“ Efficient numeric and matrix operations
- *Scikit-learn* â€“ For computing cosine similarity
- *Streamlit* â€“ For building the web interface
- *Jupyter Notebook* â€“ For data exploration and prototyping
- *Git* â€“ Version control
- *CSV* â€“ As dataset format

##  ðŸ§  How It Works

- The system reads metadata from the IMDB Top 250 dataset.
- It computes content-based similarity using text features like genres, cast, etc.
- A similarity matrix is generated and saved (similarity.npz) for faster recommendation.
- When a user selects a movie, the app fetches and displays similar movies instantly.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

IMDB_Top_250_Movies.csv: Curated dataset of top movies from IMDB with relevant metadata used for recommendations.

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment
